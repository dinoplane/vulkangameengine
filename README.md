# Alien Vulkan Engine

This repository shall trace my journey in learning vulkan by making a game engine. I have been following this [tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8327DO66nu9qYVKLDmdLW_84-yE4auCR), but I plan to migrate some of my other projects into this project (for better or worse XD). 

Edit: After my internship, I decided that I need to take a step back from Vulkan and actually understand more about graphics APIs and math. Thus, it will be a while till I come back again.

## Build Instructions
1. Download the repo
2. Run `make`
3. Run `./VulkanGameEngine`
