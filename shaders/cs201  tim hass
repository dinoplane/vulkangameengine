What does Cs has to do with Biodiversity
- Event detection from social media
- Training of interacting agent based models of political-ecological systems via optimization of expensive black-box objective functions
(modeling how are people interacting with ecosystems)
- peer to peer secure sharing of criminal intelligence
    - 2 people who are at the same level trading criminal intel
- reconstructing a criminal social network from censured link data
- constructing persistenst self healing self restarting iot to continuously monitoring political-ecological systems

- unis, and governments dont have enough money to solve this problem

- talk to businesses (despite their wishes)

6th mass extinction
- most large wild mammals many fishies and many rare plants will be gone by 2060
- most stuffies destroyed in the last 200 years

- great white shark is endangered
- african savanna elephant is listed (iucn red list) (based on count)
- cycads are poached


- curb this nonreversible destruction
- the wholesale of killing of animals and plants needs to stop
    - wild animals cant take stress and thus cant reproduce
- habitat destruction needs to be curtailed

- requires people to move away from these behaviors

private for profit firms could save this

a firm identifies a species they want to save, launch a new product or service called a biodiversity offering that is attached to buidiversity project

they maintain a public facing biodiversity dashboad that contains real time detailed and auditted information on the project and the species being saved.

fragility of government systems

first the firm buildsa model of political ecological system that contains their species

based on this model the firm identifies a biodiversity project that encourage species preserving behaviors
finally the firm implments this project and the attendatn monitoring program that feeds real time data to the firms biodiversity dashboarfd

heurisitc search and shortedt path problems
- output is always a path

nightingale - inflexion games
- heurisitc can be a path to a goal or an abstract problem traversing through states
- Djikstra's search, A*, Weighted A*, Bidirectional search, IDA*


Consistent Heuristic, Inconsistent Heuristic
- consistency may influence performance

state re-expansions
- when we revisit a state that we have expanded before

- many alforithsm encounter wost case behavior when researching though previou
visited states

inconsistent heurisitcs
-


interelated with generative AI because we start seeing sam eproblems when we apply ML to search


alfgoithm


djikstera's algorithm
- uniform cost search
expand uniformly
g(n) the best knon path frm start to n

expand states from low to high g(n)
(priority is based on cost so far)


assume that edge cost c(a, b) > 0

what happens when we have a negative edges, then we need to do re-expansion

worst case exponential
cant handle negative cost cycles!

bellman-ford fixes this
expand all states iteratively O(n^n)

O(V*E) -> O(V^2)

Djikstra->



Bidirectional search

start search in both directions
keep track of forward and backward costs
gF(n)
gB(b)
same problem as djikstra


A*
a goal-directed search

g(n) actual cost so far (to n)
h(n) an estimate from n to goal

f(n) = g(n)+h(n)


h(n)
admissible the heuristic never overestimates
consistent the triangle inequality is satisfied

unidirectional problem


when inconsistent heurisitcs... A* sucks
equivalent problem to negative edge weifhts in djikstra
- exponential worst case

Algorithm B fixes worst case
- N^2


bidirectional heurisitc search
- expand minimym g-cost
- A* but 2 directions

- doesnt do well
- possibl that the frontiers dont meet each other

1997 2 explanations
- frontierrs were going into each other (expand same states in both directions)
- even when the search meet, the search doesnt terminate

Initial solution, use a consistent herisitc
- avoid the frontiers crossing, improve heuristic

no bidirectional theoyr
- algorithm terminating late
- optimality of algorithm not well defined
if f(u) < C*-> we must expand u
- c* is the optimal cost

lb (u, v) = ax(fF(u), fB(u), gF(u)+gB(u))))


if lb(u, v) < C* m you only need to expand u or v

Gmx minimum vertex cover poblem....

write hieghest edge between the 2


find a meeting point...


A* repeatedly expand state with loweest f()n
NBS: repeated expand pair of states with lowest lb(u, v)
- may expand the same state in each direction
- no more than 2x minimal expansions / no algorithm can beat this
Near-optimal bidirectional search


Consistency, hF(u)-hF(v)


lb(max ff(u), fb(v), g+g+h)

front to fron alg


bidirectional search better than unidirectional search?

A* and IDA*
IDA, Iterative deepening of A*
- Budget Graph search, if I dont know, then i jump ahead and do the search, and avoid doing the N^2 work
- log(n) steps

-IBEX and BGS has O(N log C*)


problem - misleading heurisitc causes re-expansions
vould avoid with djiktra's algorithm

heuristic may prune many states, dont want to discard completely

If we knew the solution cost, we could guide the search by g(n) but prune states that have higher than C*
Breadthe first Heuristic Search

Estimate using exponential seach, use a budget to control the cost of overestimates

hat is maximum f fully explored with K expansions


BUdgeted tree searfch

exponential jumps in cost, to find a middle cost




Weighted A*
g cost and h cost

 put an h cost, but put a weight on h

 this creates an inconsistent heuristic

 w is an inflation factor that bounds suboptimality.

 Re expansions cause overhead O_O

 weighted A8 can do N^2 or s^n

 Re expansions are optional

 weighted A* is a one line change


 find family of algorithms that are one line changes


f(n) =  phi(h, g)


What are properties of phi that avoid reopening states,
a bounding function that controls suboptimality

A* : as g increases and h increases, the priority increases

Weighted A*: line goes from B(h) to h and the slope is steeper (higher amounts of sboptimality)

XDP: a parabola, shifts suboptimality from none to more!


previous wok didnt deeply analyze the impace of revisits
rich class of improved priority functions
can control where suboptimality arises
