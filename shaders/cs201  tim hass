What does Cs has to do with Biodiversity
- Event detection from social media
- Training of interacting agent based models of political-ecological systems via optimization of expensive black-box objective functions
(modeling how are people interacting with ecosystems)
- peer to peer secure sharing of criminal intelligence
    - 2 people who are at the same level trading criminal intel
- reconstructing a criminal social network from censured link data
- constructing persistenst self healing self restarting iot to continuously monitoring political-ecological systems

- unis, and governments dont have enough money to solve this problem

- talk to businesses (despite their wishes)

6th mass extinction
- most large wild mammals many fishies and many rare plants will be gone by 2060
- most stuffies destroyed in the last 200 years

- great white shark is endangered
- african savanna elephant is listed (iucn red list) (based on count)
- cycads are poached


- curb this nonreversible destruction
- the wholesale of killing of animals and plants needs to stop
    - wild animals cant take stress and thus cant reproduce
- habitat destruction needs to be curtailed

- requires people to move away from these behaviors

private for profit firms could save this

a firm identifies a species they want to save, launch a new product or service called a biodiversity offering that is attached to buidiversity project

they maintain a public facing biodiversity dashboad that contains real time detailed and auditted information on the project and the species being saved.

heurisitc search and shortedt path problems
- output is always a path

nightingale - inflexion games
- heurisitc can be a path to a goal or an abstract problem traversing through states
- Djikstra's search, A*, Weighted A*, Bidirectional search, IDA*


Consistent Heuristic, Inconsistent Heuristic
- consistency may influence performance

state re-expansions
- when we revisit a state that we have expanded before

- many alforithsm encounter wost case behavior when researching though previou
visited states

inconsistent heurisitcs
-


interelated with generative AI because we start seeing sam eproblems when we apply ML to search


alfgoithm


djikstera's algorithm
- uniform cost search
expand uniformly
g(n) the best knon path frm start to n

expand states from low to high g(n)
(priority is based on cost so far)


assume that edge cost c(a, b) > 0

what happens when we have a negative edges, then we need to do re-expansion

worst case exponential
cant handle negative cost cycles!

bellman-ford fixes this
expand all states iteratively O(n^n)

O(V*E) -> O(V^2)

Djikstra->



Bidirectional search

start search in both directions
keep track of forward and backward costs
gF(n)
gB(b)
same problem as djikstra


A*
a goal-directed search

g(n) actual cost so far (to n)
h(n) an estimate from n to goal

f(n) = g(n)+h(n)


h(n)
admissible the heuristic never overestimates
consistent the triangle inequality is satisfied

unidirectional problem


when inconsistent heurisitcs... A* sucks
equivalent problem to negative edge weifhts in djikstra
- exponential worst case

Algorithm B fixes worst case
- N^2


bidirectional heurisitc search
- expand minimym g-cost
- A* but 2 directions

- doesnt do well
- possibl that the frontiers dont meet each other

1997 2 explanations
- frontierrs were going into each other (expand same states in both directions)
- even when the search meet, the search doesnt terminate

Initial solution, use a consistent herisitc
- avoid the frontiers crossing, improve heuristic

no bidirectional theoyr
- algorithm terminating late
- optimality of algorithm not well defined
if f(u) < C*-> we must expand u
- c* is the optimal cost

lb (u, v) = ax(fF(u), fB(u), gF(u)+gB(u))))


if lb(u, v) < C* m you only need to expand u or v

Gmx minimum vertex cover poblem....

write hieghest edge between the 2


find a meeting point...


A* repeatedly expand state with loweest f()n
NBS: repeated expand pair of states with lowest lb(u, v)
- may expand the same state in each direction
- no more than 2x minimal expansions / no algorithm can beat this
Near-optimal bidirectional search


Consistency, hF(u)-hF(v)


lb(max ff(u), fb(v), g+g+h)

front to fron alg


bidirectional search better than unidirectional search?

A* and IDA*
IDA, Iterative deepening of A*
- Budget Graph search, if I dont know, then i jump ahead and do the search, and avoid doing the N^2 work
- log(n) steps

-IBEX and BGS has O(N log C*)


problem - misleading heurisitc causes re-expansions
vould avoid with djiktra's algorithm

heuristic may prune many states, dont want to discard completely

If we knew the solution cost, we could guide the search by g(n) but prune states that have higher than C*
Breadthe first Heuristic Search

Estimate using exponential seach, use a budget to control the cost of overestimates

hat is maximum f fully explored with K expansions


BUdgeted tree searfch

exponential jumps in cost, to find a middle cost




Weighted A*
g cost and h cost

 put an h cost, but put a weight on h

 this creates an inconsistent heuristic

 w is an inflation factor that bounds suboptimality.

 Re expansions cause overhead O_O

 weighted A8 can do N^2 or s^n

 Re expansions are optional

 weighted A* is a one line change


 find family of algorithms that are one line changes


f(n) =  phi(h, g)


What are properties of phi that avoid reopening states,
a bounding function that controls suboptimality

A* : as g increases and h increases, the priority increases

Weighted A*: line goes from B(h) to h and the slope is steeper (higher amounts of sboptimality)

XDP: a parabola, shifts suboptimality from none to more!


previous wok didnt deeply analyze the impace of revisits
rich class of improved priority functions
can control where suboptimality arises

VR

- useful for exploing new places, creating artifacts, and education,
- haptic feed back - feeling textyres ,feeling forces ,facilitating dexteritty
- in VR, we lose sense of touch

address this


goal: feeling textures and forces in VR

implementation useing a safe to touch drone

integrate into virtual reality sysstem


many challenges
- low position accuracy
    - environment influences the precision


different types of haptic
handheld, wearable, encounter-type
- all have hardware limitations
    - accuracy, speed of haptic rendering, resolution (details)
- dont need to be perfect because perception is imperfect i.e. touch fingers above head
    - can be leveraged to create an illusion


safe to touch drone
- attached fabrics
- texture rendering was coresponded to fabrics
- people instictively touch safe to touch drone
- in practice, position accuracy is problem, drone drifts away

- using retargeting illusion as a solution
3 boxes in vr, but only 1 in reality


how bain plans and controls movement
- inten converted to ignals converted to action


- offset the virtual hand opposite to what reality is, so the touch is on drone is at angles

visual dominance effect - vision dominates proprioception


evaluation revealed failure cases
- quick movements suck
- drone shifting directions
-

tabletop robot, that had different button and knobs,
- haptics controlled by robot
- failed when touching buttons far apart in virtual reality
- touch prediction
    - try to minimize jerk, the d of accel
- figure out where the robot could get to in time,
- predict how close the robot could get
- pick and choose when to use dynamic retargeting and


resolution
contour  following tasks
- shape have limited resolution
- use angle redirection to solve the rasterization problem
- redirect finger to use a horizontal or vertical land
- trace easily
- so what angle do people suspect?
at 49.5 degrees, people are sure, at 35 degrees, not sure

evaluating performance for angle redirection
- asking if the shape dsiplay was high or low res
- illusion was preferred most of the time (at 40 degrees)

scaling up for improved resolution
- scaling the resolution of the shape dsiplay
- control to display ratio
- smoother surface, and more details


- constant stimuli test
detection threshold was 1.9 times definitely, 1.63 is unsure

- at 1.8, illusion was preferred most of the time
smaller scale factor, worse results

leverage the adaptability of humans
remap users movements into VR


spectrum of verity

reality -> illusory -> beyond real interactions

locomotion
- amplifying motion, 10x as a giant or 10x speed.
- giant accuacy was good
- spped was more motion sick...


VR intercepts the sensory apparatus
- vision is being intercepted by what we areing from head set

discrrepancy sall so visual dominance


beyond real creates a transfomration between senses and what is being rendered
cant resolve discrepancy, but can adapt to it

dont need to tangle self in wires


comp gamers dont like wireless to avoid packet losses despite wires being tangling


Data rates in wifi
each data rate needs a certain minimum snr


lower data rates atake more time and waste time and energy

save power vs packet loss


wifi used ofdm

20 mhs channels divided into narrow sub carriers

groups of bits are sent through eah subcarriers
ifmany sub carriers are poor we have packet losses


how bad can this get with average gamer distance fromm console antenna


during active game play

wire less channel changes rapidly and losses increase significantly

during active gameplay

up to 10-15dB chanfges within 50-80ms

adaptive data rate cannot keep p

siring acitve game play prior user studies assume uncorrelated losses

consecutive losses are common


audio glitches are distracting

xbox transmits PCM audio in 8ms chunks each loss introduces a discontinuity


its possible to hear 1% loss

joystick does not respond well
packeet losses create discontinuities
can topple a car at high speed

audio exp is expereienved

controllers are battery powered 200-400MHz ARM processors

Xbox controllers suty controllers


first thoughts
2 decades, use previous ML techniques ()some might be bad



we should use RL

and learn a policy that determines data rate based on recent history of channel of measurement

needs to be continuous and online robust and a fast learner

each time the console transmits a packet measure the cSi and snr of eireless channel in reverse direction and record xduscces

learna a rate selction policy base don data
 reverse and foward channels
 measurements are not the same

 tc power diff agc diffs devices h/w


 ANNs can lear online to model mwireless channels

 wireless channel changes are hard to characterize analytically latent effects
 depend on the game, gamers motions e.w

 we can use neural nets to learn and model these effects !

both stream are kept on

famer hears 2 audio game streasms at a time

echo problem because of game audio is heard via the mic due to the server to ear latency for these two paths are diff

40-50 ms of gap between the two streams

sometimes the streams go through differen paths

no control over som endpoints hinfers measurements

RTT incurrrs erorr


correlate over heard sound from the screen and one received at the headphones to estimate the interstream delay

server embeds inaudible acoustic PN seq in the game audio
the headphone controller time stamps sample numbers and convus them to serrvcer
the micorphone at the headset recods the overheadd sound from the screen inclusinng the embedded pn sequences

serve estimates delay diff by corelating the PN sequences
