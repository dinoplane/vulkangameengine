Wildlife trafficking
- cycads (dug up in africa for this purpose)

What does Cs has to do with Biodiversity
- Event detection from social media
- Training of interacting agent based models of political-ecological systems via optimization of expensive black-box objective functions
(modeling how are people interacting with ecosystems)
- peer to peer secure sharing of criminal intelligence
    - 2 people who are at the same level trading criminal intel
- reconstructing a criminal social network from censured link data
- constructing persistenst self healing self restarting iot to continuously monitoring political-ecological systems

- unis, and governments dont have enough money to solve this problem

- talk to businesses (despite their wishes)

6th mass extinction
- most large wild mammals many fishies and many rare plants will be gone by 2060
- most stuffies destroyed in the last 200 years

- great white shark is endangered
- african savanna elephant is listed (iucn red list) (based on count)
- cycads are poached


- curb this nonreversible destruction
- the wholesale of killing of animals and plants needs to stop
    - wild animals cant take stress and thus cant reproduce
- habitat destruction needs to be curtailed

- requires people to move away from these behaviors

private for profit firms could save this

a firm identifies a species they want to save, launch a new product or service called a biodiversity offering that is attached to buidiversity project

they maintain a public facing biodiversity dashboad that contains real time detailed and auditted information on the project and the species being saved.


firms exist to make a profit biodiverssity offerins would be prc#End Region
firms are resoucefil and distributed
firms hold most of the worlds wealth and expertise collectively they have the resouces to solve a plante level problem
firms are not all under a single hierachical control structure a few newly minted tyrants would not abe able to shutdown all firm-level biodiverstiy projects

fragility of government systems

first the firm buildsa model of political ecological system that contains their species

based on this model the firm identifies a biodiversity project that encourage species preserving behaviors
finally the firm implments this project and the attendatn monitoring program that feeds real time data to the firms biodiversity dashboarfd
