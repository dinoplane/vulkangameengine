Artificial intelligence for Hemodynamic Analysis of Cardiovascular Medicine

- Hemodynamics
how blood flows through blood vessels
- Heart rate
- Flow velocity
- Blood pressure


Abnormalities correlated with Cardiovascular disease

Sensors can monitor blood flow that MRIs and go beyond curent technology

Hemodynamic database can more accurately predict sisease and provide better treatment

Non-Eculidean Mixtue Model for Social Network Embedding

Social Netweoks omnipresent they model interactions on social platforms

Analysis key to several

Network links are formed by homophily and social indluence

associated nodes imply feature similarity

popular nodes have direc influence in forming links


Objservations Shallow embedding models do not effectively learn graph structure

Models do not captuea ll netwoerk factos

All network structures are modeled in the same space






encoder maps nodes into z^s homophily and z^h social influence

Objective maximize likeluhood to obsere links

design space unification component to alighn the distinct geometric spaces'
ensuring two embeddings of the same node are coesponding to each other
