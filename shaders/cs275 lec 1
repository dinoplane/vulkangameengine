a9Invetigate the role that Alife concepts can play in advanced models fo graphics

New models that realistically emulate a broad variety of living things

plants to animals lower animals to humans

New graphics algorithms inspired by biological processes



What is life

Aristotle
    living things have a "soul"
    properties of life
    Birth Consumption of energy/nourishment
    Growth
    Reproduction
    Death

Darwin
    Evolution (still up to debate)

Watson & Crick
    DNA as the basis of Evolution i.e. genetic info -> gene expression

What does it mean to be alive?

Life is a pattern in space-time, rather than a specific material object

Self-reproduction

Information storage of a self-representation

A metabolism

Functional interactions with the environment

The ability to evolve



Artificial Life

John Von Neumann
    The father of artificial Life
    Life and automata theory
    Reproduction - transfer of info

John Conway
    Cellular automata "The game of life"

Christopher Langton
    Langton loops automata
    Organized first conference on Artificial Life

Typically Alife models inhait virtual worlds and are subject to physical laws

More significantly they must also simulate many natural processes of living systems


Biomechanics, Locomotion, Perception, Behavior, Learning, Cognition


Challenge

Develop sophisticated new graphics models that are

self-creating
self-developing
self-evolving
self-controlling
self-animating



ACROSS HEAVEN AND EARTH, I ALONE AM THE EXCEPTION
